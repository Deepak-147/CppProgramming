/*
In traditional programming data and the functions that work on that data are separate entities that are combined
together to produce the desired result. Because of this separation, traditional programming often does not provide
a very intuitive representation of reality. It's up to the programmer to manage and connect the properties (variables)
to the behaviors (functions) in an appropriate manner.

Objects have two major components to them:
1) Properties (Ex: weight, color, size, etc...)
2) Behaviors that they can exhibit.(Ex: walking, talking, etc...)
These properties and behaviors are inseparable.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) provides us with the ability to create objects that tie together both properties and behaviors
into a self-contained, reusable package. This allows programs to be written in a more modular fashion, which makes them easier
to write and understand, and also provides a higher degree of code-reusability. These objects also provide a more intuitive
way to work with our data by allowing us to define how we interact with the objects, and how they interact with other objects.
Note that OOP doesn’t replace traditional programming methods. Rather, it gives you additional tools in your programming tool belt to manage complexity when needed.
